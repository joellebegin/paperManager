wishlist:

## improve dbase structure

- need some way to indicate who is first author (ACTUALLY: the list of authors for each paper is appended in order so just gotta make sure that whenever i add a new paper, I add the authors in order) [DONE]
- actually i think it's really lame that I have an entry for each author which has a ton of duplicates.... any way to have one cell in spreadsheet that has "First author, second author, etc" and then split these up later in the dbase? [DONE]
- Maybe make it so don't have to define separate tag objects: have one grand unified tag object [DONE]
- add path to file

## improve query

- for author query: display tags, other authors [DONE]
- add query for tags
- add query to list all tags
- add option to open paper. want call to be ```open {FIRST AUTHOR LAST NAME}{YEAR}```

## make function to add a paper to dbase

- must be able to add to all authors and tags at once


## EVENTUALLY, but this is big: add CLI!

- would be super cute to be able to list all papers by some author and it'll look like 
``` 
1. paper 1
2. paper 2
3. paper 3 
```
- and then you just gotta input "2" for example and it'll open the pdf of paper 2.
