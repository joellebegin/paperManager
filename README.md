wishlist:

## improve dbase structure

- need some way to indicate who is first author
-Maybe make it so don't have to define separate tag objects: have one grand unified tag object
-add path to file

## improve query

-for author query: display tags, other authors
- add query for tags
- add query to list all tags
-add option to open paper. want call to be ```open {FIRST AUTHOR LAST NAME}{YEAR}```

## make function to add a paper to dbase

- must be able to add to all authors and tags at once


EVENTUALLY, but this is big: add CLI!
